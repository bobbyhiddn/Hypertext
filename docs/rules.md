## Setup

1. **Shuffle** the main deck (90 cards) to form the **Tower**.
2. **Shuffle** the phase deck (30 phases).
3. **Deal 7 cards** to each player.
4. **Deal 1 Phase card** to each player face-up (Lot).
5. **Flip 1 Phase card** to the center (Board Phase).
6. Place remaining decks face-down. Start a face-up **Sheol** (discard pile).

---

## Two Phase Types

| Phase Type | Location | Reward | Cards Go... |
|------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Board Phase** | Center of table | Points (12–20) + closer bonus | Your Pages (open) |
| **Lot** | In front of you | 1 Letter (worth 5 pts) | Sheol |

- **Board Phase:** Score points. Cards stay on table in your Pages.
- **Lot:** Earn Letters. Cards leave your hand to Sheol.

---

## Turn Sequence

### 1. Draw

Draw 1 card from the Tower.

### 2. Play

**Free Activation (once per turn):**
- You may reveal the card you just drew.
- Pay its rarity cost (discard cards from hand).
- Resolve ability.
- Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).

**Letter Activation (repeatable):**
- Spend 1 Letter to reveal a card from your hand.
- Pay its rarity cost.
- Resolve ability.
- Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).

### 3. Record

You may record as many times as you are able:

**Record Board Phase:**
- Play cards from hand matching the Board Phase composition exactly.
- Place cards face-up in your Pages.
- Score the phase's point value.
- **First player** to record the Board Phase gets **+5 closer bonus**.

**Record Lot:**
- Play cards from hand matching your Lot composition exactly.
- Cards go to Sheol.
- Earn **1 Letter token**.

**Record to Opponent's Lot:**
- Play cards from hand matching any opponent's Lot exactly.
- Cards go to Sheol.
- You score nothing but dump cards.

### 4. End

**Discard 1 card** to Sheol.

If your hand is empty, the chapter ends immediately (skip to Chapter End).

---

## Redeem

When a player discards at End, any other player may call **"Redeem!"** to take that card.

- First to call becomes the card's **redeemer**.
- The redeemer takes the discarded card into their hand.
- The redeemer must discard 1 card at the end of their next turn (in addition to their normal discard).
- Limit: 1 redeem per player per chapter.
- Activated cards and their costs **cannot be redeemed**—only End discards.

---

## Chapter End

When a player empties their hand:

1. **Grace period:** All other players may play to any open phases (Board Phase or Lots) if they have exact matches.
2. **Score records:** Points already earned during play.
3. **Convert Letters:** Each Letter = 5 points. Add to score.
4. **Hand penalty:** -1 point per card remaining in hand.
5. **Reset:**
   - All Letters reset to 0.
   - Collect all Lot cards, reshuffle into phase deck.
   - Deal new Lot to each player.
   - Flip new Board Phase (no repeats; redraw if duplicate).
   - Reshuffle Sheol into Tower if needed.
   - Deal 7 new cards to each player.

---

## Game End

The game ends after **12 chapters**.

The player with the highest total score wins.

---

## The Matthias Rule (Tiebreaker)

> *"And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Matthias."* — Acts 1:26

If two or more players are tied for highest score after 12 chapters:

1. Only tied players participate in a 13th chapter.
2. Deal 7 cards to each tied player.
3. Flip a new Board Phase.
4. Play proceeds normally (draw, play, record, end).
5. **First to record the Board Phase wins the game.**
6. No points scored—just victory.

## Special Rules

### TITLE Cards
TITLE cards are wild. They may substitute for NOUN or NAME in any record. A TITLE counts as whichever type you declare when recording.

### Tower Empty
Shuffle Sheol to form a new Tower. Continue play.

### Phase Deck Cycling
When all phases have been used as Board Phases, reshuffle the phase deck. The Board Phase may not repeat consecutively—redraw if duplicate.

---

## Design Notes

The tension in Hypertext:

- **Play vs. Record:** Abilities give tempo, but activated cards can't record. Burn for advantage or hold for points?
- **Board vs. Lot:** Board Phases score big but don't shrink your hand. Lots dump cards fast but score less.
- **Racing:** First to record the Board Phase gets +5. But overcommitting leaves you vulnerable if you can't empty your hand.
- **Letter Economy:** Letters fuel extra activations and convert to points. Spend for tempo or bank for score?
- **Redeem:** Watch the discard—snatch what you need, but you'll owe an extra card next turn.
