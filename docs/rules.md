# Hypertext: Rules of Play

## Overview

Hypertext is a word-study trading card game for 2–4 players. Complete **Quartets**—sets of four related cards—before the deck runs out. Score points through contributions, timing, and hidden objectives.

The deck is your shared opponent. If the table fails to complete enough Quartets, everyone loses.

## Components

- **60 Card Deck** (15 Quartets × 4 cards each)
- **Personal Objective Cards** (12)
- **Season Goal Cards** (9)
- **Score Tracker / Tokens**

## Card Anatomy

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Number** | Collector ID (#001–#060) |
| **Word** | The English word |
| **Gloss** | Short definition |
| **Type** | NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, NAME, or TITLE |
| **Rarity** | COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE, or GLORIOUS |
| **Art** | Thematic illustration |
| **Stats** | LORE, CONTEXT, COMPLEXITY (1–5 each) |
| **Ability** | Effect when revealed |

## Card Types

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| **NOUN** | Person, place, thing, or concept |
| **VERB** | Action or state |
| **ADJECTIVE** | Descriptive word |
| **NAME** | Proper noun (person or place) |
| **TITLE** | Wild card—can substitute for NOUN or NAME when completing a Quartet (limit 1 per meld) |

---

## Rarity & Abilities

Abilities trigger **only when a card is revealed on draw** (see Turn Sequence). Rarity determines ability complexity:

| Rarity | Icon | Ability Pattern |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **COMMON** | ○ White circle | Simple effect (e.g., "Draw 1 card") |
| **UNCOMMON** | ■ Green square | Type-based effect (e.g., "Discard a VERB to draw 2") |
| **RARE** | ⬡ Gold hexagon | Stat-based effect (e.g., "Draw cards equal to this card's LORE") |
| **GLORIOUS** | ◆ Orange diamond | Unique effect, may reference other cards |

---

## Stats

Stats exist to scale or constrain abilities:

| Stat | Meaning | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| **LORE** | Alignment to the Biblical meta-narrative | 1–5 |
| **CONTEXT** | Frequency of occurrence in Scripture | 1–5 |
| **COMPLEXITY** | Grammatical/linguistic depth | 1–5 |

---

## Setup

1. **Shuffle** the main deck.
2. **Deal 7 cards** to each player.
3. **Reveal 4 Quartet Goals** face-up in the center. Each Goal shows a Quartet ID (e.g., NOUN-01). Adjust by player count:
   - 2 players: 3 Goals
   - 3 players: 4 Goals
   - 4 players: 5 Goals
4. **Deal 2 Personal Objectives** to each player. Keep 1, discard the other face-down.
5. **Reveal 3 Season Goals** (shared end-game scoring conditions).
6. Place the remaining deck face-down. Create a face-up **discard pile**.

---

## Quartet Goals

Each active Quartet Goal has four slots: **A, B, C, D**.

Any player may play a matching card to any open slot. A Goal is **complete** when all four slots are filled.

---

## Turn Sequence

On your turn:

### 1. Draw

Draw 1 card from the deck.

### 2. Reveal or Keep

Choose one:

- **Reveal:** Show the card to all players. Resolve its ability. Then place the card in your **Spent pile**. (Spent cards cannot be used to complete Quartets.)

- **Keep:** Add the card to your hand silently. No ability triggers.

### 3. Play (Optional)

You may play **0 or 1 card** from your hand to an active Quartet Goal:

- The card's **Quartet ID** must match the Goal.
- The card's **Letter** (A, B, C, or D) must be an unfilled slot.
- **TITLE** cards may only be played to **complete** a NOUN or NAME Quartet, and only if no other TITLE is already in that meld.

### 4. Discard (If No Play)

If you did not play a card this turn, you **may** discard 1 card face-up. (This is optional—you may hold your hand.)

---

## Completing a Quartet (Melding)

When a Quartet Goal reaches A + B + C + D:

1. **Closer Bonus:** The player who played the 4th card scores **2 points**.
2. **Contribution Points:** Each other player who contributed to that Quartet scores **1 point per card** they played.
3. **Remove** the completed Quartet from play.
4. **Reveal** a new Quartet Goal from the deck (if able).

---

## Personal Objectives

Dealt at setup, kept secret until game end. Examples:

| Objective | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Grammarian** | Score 2 points for each Quartet you contributed to where your card had COMPLEXITY 4+. |
| **Evangelist** | Score 3 points if you contributed to 4+ different Quartets. |
| **Theologian** | Score 2 points for each GLORIOUS card you revealed during the game. |
| **Scribe** | Score 1 point for each card remaining in your hand at game end. |
| **Prophet** | Score 4 points if you played the closing card on 2+ Quartets. |
| **Linguist** | Score 2 points for each Quartet you contributed to containing both Greek and Hebrew terms with COMPLEXITY 3+. |

---

## Season Goals

Revealed at setup. All players who qualify score these at game end. Examples:

| Season Goal | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Lore Keepers** | Score 1 point per Quartet you contributed to that totals 12+ LORE across its 4 cards. |
| **Pentecost** | Score 2 points if you contributed at least 1 card to a NAME Quartet. |
| **Exegesis** | Score 1 point per VERB Quartet you contributed to. |
| **Deep Study** | Score 2 points if you contributed to a Quartet where all 4 cards have COMPLEXITY 3+. |
| **Concordance** | Score 1 point for each unique card type (NOUN, VERB, etc.) among your contributions. |

---

## Game End

The game ends when:

- The **deck is empty**, AND
- **No player can legally play** a card to any active Goal.

Finish the round so all players take the same number of turns.

---

## Final Scoring

1. **Quartet Contributions** — Points earned during play (closer bonuses + contribution points).
2. **Personal Objective** — Reveal and score.
3. **Season Goals** — All qualifying players score.

### Threshold Check

Count total Quartets completed by all players.

| Players | Minimum Quartets | Result if Below |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| 2 | 5 | The deck wins. All players lose. |
| 3 | 6 | The deck wins. All players lose. |
| 4 | 7 | The deck wins. All players lose. |

If the threshold is met, **highest score wins**.

---

## Tiebreakers

In order:

1. Most Quartets where you played the closing card.
2. Most total cards contributed.
3. Fewest cards remaining in hand.
4. Shared victory.

---

## Quick Reference

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Reveal** | Trigger ability → card goes to Spent pile |
| **Keep** | Card goes to hand silently |
| **Play** | Place card on matching Goal slot |
| **Discard** | Optional if you didn't play |
| **Meld** | Complete a Quartet → score points |

| Scoring | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Play closing card | 2 |
| Contribute a card | 1 (when Quartet completes) |
| Personal Objective | Varies |
| Season Goal | Varies |

---

## Design Notes

The tension in Hypertext:

- **Reveal vs. Keep:** Abilities give tempo, but spent cards can't score. Do you burn for advantage or hold for points?
- **Early vs. Late contribution:** Contributing early secures points but helps opponents close. Holding for the closer bonus risks someone else finishing—or the Goal stalling.
- **Personal vs. Collective:** Your hidden objective may conflict with helping the table hit threshold. Sandbag too hard and everyone loses.
