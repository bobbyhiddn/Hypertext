## Rarity & Abilities

Abilities activate when you **reveal** a card. You may activate at two times:

1. **At Draw (free):** Reveal the card you just drew, pay rarity cost, resolve ability. Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).
2. **During Turn (costs Letter):** Spend 1 Letter, reveal a card from hand, pay rarity cost, resolve ability. Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).

Activated cards cannot be recorded—they go to the Sheol (along with any cards discarded to pay the activation cost). **Activated cards and their costs cannot be redeemed.**

### Ability Costs

| Rarity | Icon | Cost to Activate |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **COMMON** | ◆ White | Reveal only |
| **UNCOMMON** | ◆ Green | Discard 1 from hand |
| **RARE** | ◆ Gold | Discard 2 from hand |
| **GLORIOUS** | ◆ Orange | Discard 3 from hand |

### Activation Limits

- 1 free activation per turn (at draw)
- Unlimited activations via Letter spend (during turn)

## Setup

1. **Shuffle** the main deck (90 cards) to form the **Tower**.
2. **Shuffle** the phase deck (30 phases).
3. **Deal 7 cards** to each player.
4. **Deal 1 Phase card** to each player face-up (Lot).
5. **Flip 1 Phase card** to the center (Board Phase).
6. Place remaining decks face-down. Start a face-up **Sheol** (discard pile).

---

## Two Phase Types

| Phase Type | Location | Reward | Cards Go... |
|------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Board Phase** | Center of table | Points (12–20) + closer bonus | Your Pages (open) |
| **Lot** | In front of you | 1 Letter (worth 5 pts) | Sheol |

- **Board Phase:** Score points. Cards stay on table in your Pages.
- **Lot:** Earn Letters. Cards leave your hand to Sheol.

---

## Turn Sequence

### 1. Draw

Choose one:
- **Draw** 1 card from the Tower, OR
- **Redeem** the top card of Sheol, if it was an end-of-turn discard (you must then discard 1 card at end of turn; limit 1 redeem per turn)

### 2. Reveal or Keep (if drawing from deck)

Choose one:
- **Reveal:** Show the drawn card. Pay its rarity cost. Resolve ability. Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).
- **Keep:** Add card to hand silently. No ability triggers.

### 3. Record (Optional, Repeatable)

You may record as many times as you are able:

**Record Board Phase:**
- Play cards from hand matching the Board Phase composition exactly.
- Place cards face-up in your Pages.
- Score the phase's point value.
- **First player** to record the Board Phase gets **+5 closer bonus**.

**Record Lot:**
- Play cards from hand matching your Lot composition exactly.
- Cards go to the Sheol.
- Earn **1 Letter token**.

You may record both Board Phase and Lot in the same turn, multiple times each if able.

### 4. Letter Activation (Optional, Repeatable)

Spend 1 Letter to activate a card from your hand:
- Reveal the card.
- Pay its rarity cost (discard cards from hand).
- Resolve ability.
- Card and cost go to Sheol (not redeemable).

Repeat as many times as you have Letters.

### 5. Discard

Choose one:
- **Discard 1 card** to Sheol, OR
- **Play to opponent's phase:** Record a complete set matching any opponent's Lot (cards go to Sheol; you score nothing but dump cards)

If your hand is empty, the chapter ends immediately (skip to Chapter End).

---

## Chapter End

When a player empties their hand:

1. **Grace period:** All other players may play to any open phases (Board Phase or Lots) if they have exact matches.
2. **Score records:** Points already earned during play.
3. **Convert Letters:** Each Letter = 5 points. Add to score.
4. **Hand penalty:** -1 point per card remaining in hand.
5. **Reset:**
   - All Letters reset to 0.
   - Collect all Lot cards, reshuffle into phase deck.
   - Deal new Lot to each player.
   - Flip new Board Phase (no repeats; redraw if duplicate).
   - Reshuffle Sheol into Tower if needed.
   - Deal 7 new cards to each player.

---

## Game End

The game ends after **12 chapters**.

The player with the highest total score wins.

---

## The Matthias Rule (Tiebreaker)

> *"And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Matthias."* — Acts 1:26

If two or more players are tied for highest score after 12 chapters:

1. Only tied players participate in a 13th chapter.
2. Deal 7 cards to each tied player.
3. Flip a new Board Phase.
4. Play proceeds normally (draw, record, discard).
5. **First to record the Board Phase wins the game.**
6. No points scored—just victory.

## Visibility

| Board Phase | Open |
| Lots | Open (each player's Lot visible) |

## Special Rules

### TITLE Cards
TITLE cards are wild. They may substitute for NOUN or NAME in any record. A TITLE counts as whichever type you declare when recording.

### Tower Empty
Shuffle Sheol to form a new Tower. Continue play.

### Phase Deck Cycling
When all phases have been used as Board Phases, reshuffle the phase deck. The Board Phase may not repeat consecutively—redraw if duplicate.

---

## Design Notes

The tension in Hypertext:

- **Reveal vs. Keep:** Abilities give tempo, but activated cards can't record. Burn for advantage or hold for points?
- **Board vs. Lot:** Board Phases score big but don't shrink your hand. Lots dump cards fast but score less.
- **Racing:** First to record the Board Phase gets +5. But overcommitting leaves you vulnerable if you can't empty your hand.
- **Letter Economy:** Letters fuel extra activations and convert to points. Spend for tempo or bank for score?
