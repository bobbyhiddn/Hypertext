# Hypertext: Rules of Play

## Overview

Hypertext is a word-study trading card game for 2–4 players. Build and score **Quartets**—sets of four related cards—to earn points. The goal is to finish with the highest score.

---

## Components

- **90 Card Deck** (22 Quartets × 4 cards each + 2 extra cards)
- **Score Tracker / Tokens**

---

## Card Anatomy

Each card has:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Number** | Collector ID (#001–#090) |
| **Word** | The English word |
| **Gloss** | Short definition |
| **Type** | NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, NAME, or TITLE |
| **Rarity** | COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE, or GLORIOUS |
| **Art** | Thematic illustration |
| **Stats** | LORE, CONTEXT, COMPLEXITY (1–5 each) |
| **Ability** | Effect when revealed |
| **Verses** | OT and NT scripture references |
| **Greek/Hebrew** | Original language forms |
| **Trivia** | Educational bullet points |
| **Quartet ID** | Group identifier (e.g., NOUN-01) |
| **Letter** | Position in quartet (A, B, C, or D) |

## Card Types

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| **NOUN** | Person, place, thing, or concept |
| **VERB** | Action or state |
| **ADJECTIVE** | Descriptive word |
| **NAME** | Proper noun (person or place) |
| **TITLE** | Wild card—can substitute for NOUN or NAME when completing a Quartet (limit 1 per meld) |

---

## Rarity & Abilities

When you draw a card, you may either **keep it** (add to hand silently) or **play its ability** by paying its cost.

### Ability Costs

| Rarity | Icon | Cost to Play Ability |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **COMMON** | ◆ White diamond | Reveal the card (no discard) |
| **UNCOMMON** | ◆ Green diamond | Discard 1 card from hand |
| **RARE** | ◆ Gold diamond | Discard 2 cards from hand |
| **GLORIOUS** | ◆ Orange diamond | Discard 3 cards from hand |

If you choose not to pay the cost (or cannot), simply keep the card in your hand.

### Ability Design Principles

Abilities should provide **card advantage**—not just replace themselves. "Draw a card" alone is not an ability; it's neutral tempo. Abilities must generate value beyond the card itself.

Abilities should be concise (one short to medium line) and match the word's flavor.

| Rarity | Ability Pattern |
|--------|-----------------|
| **COMMON** | Simple effect with immediate value |
| **UNCOMMON** | Type-based effect (references card types like NOUN, VERB) |
| **RARE** | Stat-based effect (scales with LORE, CONTEXT, or COMPLEXITY). Must not reference its own stats. |
| **GLORIOUS** | Unique/combo effect. Performs an action that is thematically consistent with the card's flavor, and does more than any other suit. |

---

## Stats

Stats exist to scale or constrain abilities:

| Stat | Meaning | Range |
|------|---------|-------|
| **LORE** | Alignment to the Biblical meta-narrative | 1–5 |
| **CONTEXT** | Frequency of occurrence in Scripture | 1–5 |
| **COMPLEXITY** | Grammatical/linguistic depth | 1–5 |

---

## Setup

1. **Shuffle** the main deck.
2. **Deal 7 cards** to each player.
3. **Reveal 4 Quartet Goals** face-up in the center. Each Goal shows a Quartet ID (e.g., NOUN-01). Adjust by player count:
   - 2 players: 3 Goals
   - 3 players: 4 Goals
   - 4 players: 5 Goals
4. Place the remaining deck face-down. Create a face-up **discard pile**.

---

## Quartet Goals

Each active Quartet Goal has four slots: **A, B, C, D**.

Any player may play a matching card to any open slot. A Goal is **complete** when all four slots are filled.

---

## Turn Sequence

On your turn:

### 1. Draw

Draw 1 card from the deck.

### 2. Reveal or Keep

Choose one:

- **Reveal:** Show the card to all players. Resolve its ability. Then place the card in your **Spent pile**. (Spent cards cannot be used to complete Quartets.)

- **Keep:** Add the card to your hand silently. No ability triggers.

### 3. Play (Optional)

You may play **0 or 1 card** from your hand to an active Quartet Goal:

- The card's **Quartet ID** must match the Goal.
- The card's **Letter** (A, B, C, or D) must be an unfilled slot.
- **TITLE** cards may only be played to **complete** a NOUN or NAME Quartet, and only if no other TITLE is already in that meld.

### 4. Discard (If No Play)

If you did not play a card this turn, you **may** discard 1 card face-up. (This is optional—you may hold your hand.)

---

## Completing a Quartet (Melding)

When a Quartet Goal reaches A + B + C + D:

1. The player who played the 4th card **scores the Quartet** for **4 points**.
2. Move the completed Quartet (all 4 cards) to the face-up **discard pile**.
3. **Remove** the completed Quartet Goal from play.
4. **Reveal** a new Quartet Goal from the deck (if able).

---

## Game End

The game ends when any player reaches **20 points**.

If the deck runs out of cards before anyone reaches 20, finish the round so all players take the same number of turns.

In practice, 20 points is typically reachable in fewer than ~22 turns because each scored Quartet is worth 4 points.

---

## Final Scoring

1. **Quartets Scored** — Points earned during play (4 per scored Quartet).

If a player reached 20 points, they win immediately.

If the deck ran out first, highest score wins.

---

## Tiebreakers

In order:

1. Most Quartets where you played the closing card.
2. Most total cards contributed.
3. Fewest cards remaining in hand.
4. Shared victory.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Reveal** | Trigger ability → card goes to Spent pile |
| **Keep** | Card goes to hand silently |
| **Play** | Place card on matching Goal slot |
| **Discard** | Optional if you didn't play |
| **Meld** | Complete a Quartet → score points |

| Scoring | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Score a Quartet | 4 |
| Personal Objective | Varies |
| Season Goal | Varies |

---

## Design Notes

The tension in Hypertext:

- **Reveal vs. Keep:** Abilities give tempo, but spent cards can't score. Do you burn for advantage or hold for points?
- **Early vs. Late contribution:** Contributing early secures points but helps opponents close. Holding for the closer bonus risks someone else finishing—or the Goal stalling.
- **Personal vs. Collective:** Your hidden objective may conflict with helping the table hit threshold. Sandbag too hard and everyone loses.
