REVISION INSTRUCTIONS:
Remove the left card icon in the top right corner. Also, ensure all pips are filled. Finally, use the correct noun icon as per the other noun card. It's close, but we need those three changes to be complete.

REVISION INSTRUCTIONS:
Replace the right noun icon with the + Card icon from the reference.

REVISION INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the noun icon from the style reference and set the rarity to rare, not card. Also, set the pips to the card stats in the prompt, not completely filled. But it's close. 

REVISION INSTRUCTIONS:
Only issue now is the context pips need to be set to 3, and lore needs to be set to 4
