• In the New Testament, righteousness is often presented as a gift from God (imputed) rather than solely earned by human effort.
• The 'Breastplate of Righteousness' is a key piece of the spiritual armor described in Ephesians 6.
• Abraham's belief in God was credited to him as righteousness long before the Law of Moses was given.

ART: A golden plumb line hanging perfectly straight, glowing with inner light, set against a backdrop of crooked, shadowy stone pillars. The light from the line reveals the imperfections of the surrounding architecture.
