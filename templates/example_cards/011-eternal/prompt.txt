LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: קֶדֶם (qedem) - Gen 21:33 • Isa 40:28 • Ps 90:2 • Eccl 3:11
Greek: αἰώνιος (aiōnios) - John 3:16 • John 17:3 • 2 Cor 4:18 • 1 John 5:11

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew word 'qedem' in Deut 33:27 literally means 'ancient' or 'east', implying a time before time.
• The Greek 'aionios' is derived from 'aion' (age), suggesting a quality of life found in God rather than just endless duration.
• In theology, 'eternal' (timeless) is often distinguished from 'everlasting' (unending time).
• Eternal life in the Gospel of John is defined relationally: knowing the only true God.

ART: A seamless golden ring floating in a star-filled void, glowing with an inner light that has no beginning or end.
