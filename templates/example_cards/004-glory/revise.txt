# Card_Art_Prompt: A blinding, golden radiance erupting from behind a torn heavy velvet veil, illuminating a dark stone temple interior with intense beams of light.
# Card_OT_Verse: Exodus 33:18 — And he said, 'Please, show me Your glory.'
# Card_NT_Verse: John 1:14 — We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.
# Card_Hebrew: כָּבוֹד (kabod)
# Card_Greek: δόξα (doxa)
# Card_Trivia_1: The Hebrew word 'kabod' literally means 'weight' or 'heaviness,' suggesting that God's glory has tangible substance.
# Card_Trivia_2: In the New Testament, 'doxa' shifts from its secular meaning of 'opinion' to describing the manifest radiance of God.
# Card_Trivia_3: The 'Shekinah' glory describes God's visible dwelling presence, a concept central to the tabernacle though the specific word is not in the Bible.
# Card_Trivia_4: Moses asked to see God's glory but was only allowed to see His 'back,' as His full presence would be fatal to a mortal.
