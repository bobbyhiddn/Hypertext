VERSES:
OT: Exodus 33:18 — "And he said, 'Please, show me Your glory.'"

LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: כָּבוֹד (kabod) - Ex 33:18 • Ps 19:1 • Isa 6:3 • Hab 2:14
Greek: δόξα (doxa) - John 1:14 • Rom 3:23 • 2 Cor 3:18 • Rev 21:23

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew word 'kabod' literally means 'weight' or 'heaviness,' suggesting that God's glory has tangible substance.
• In the New Testament, 'doxa' shifts from its secular meaning of 'opinion' to describing the manifest radiance of God.
• The 'Shekinah' glory describes God's visible dwelling presence, a concept central to the tabernacle though the specific word is not in the Bible.
• Moses asked to see God's glory but was only allowed to see His 'back,' as His full presence would be fatal to a mortal.

ART: A blinding, golden radiance erupting from behind a torn heavy velvet veil, illuminating a dark stone temple interior with intense beams of light.
