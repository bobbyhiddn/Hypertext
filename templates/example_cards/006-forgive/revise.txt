# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# CURRENT CARD (edit values below to request changes)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Card_Word: FORGIVE
# Card_Gloss: To cease feeling resentment against an offender; to pardon a fault or cancel a debt.
# Card_Type: VERB
# Card_Rarity: UNCOMMON
# Card_Ability: Return a card from Sheol to the top of the Tower.
# Card_Stats: LORE 4 | CONTEXT 5 | COMPLEXITY 3
# Card_Art_Prompt: A pair of weathered hands gently releasing a glowing, white dove into a dark, stormy sky; the light from the bird illuminates the hands, breaking shadowy chains around the wrists.
# Card_OT_Verse: Jeremiah 31:34 — For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
# Card_NT_Verse: Ephesians 4:32 — Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
# Card_Hebrew: סָלַח (salach)
# Card_Greek: ἀφίημι (aphiēmi)
# Card_Trivia_1: The Hebrew word 'salach' is used exclusively to describe God's forgiveness, never human forgiveness.
# Card_Trivia_2: The Greek 'aphiemi' literally means 'to send away,' like releasing a prisoner or canceling a financial debt.
# Card_Trivia_3: In the Lord's Prayer, 'debts' is used metaphorically for sins, linking forgiveness to the cancellation of what is owed.
# Card_Trivia_4: Jesus' command to forgive 'seventy times seven' times implies a limitless, ongoing attitude of mercy.
