![FORGIVE card](./outputs/card_1024x1536.png)

## Word
**FORGIVE** — To cease feeling resentment against an offender; to pardon a fault or cancel a debt.

## Old Testament
> Jeremiah 31:34 — "For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."

## New Testament
> Ephesians 4:32 — "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."

## Trivia
- The Hebrew word 'salach' is used exclusively to describe God's forgiveness, never human forgiveness.
- The Greek 'aphiemi' literally means 'to send away,' like releasing a prisoner or canceling a financial debt.
- In the Lord's Prayer, 'debts' is used metaphorically for sins, linking forgiveness to the cancellation of what is owed.
- Jesus' command to forgive 'seventy times seven' times implies a limitless, ongoing attitude of mercy.
