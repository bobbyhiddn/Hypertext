LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: סָלַח (salach) - Ex 34:7 • Ps 86:5 • Ps 103:3 • Isa 43:25 • Mic 7:18
Greek: ἀφίημι (aphiēmi) - Matt 6:12 • Matt 18:21 • Luke 23:34 • Col 3:13 • 1 John 1:9

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew word 'salach' is used exclusively to describe God's forgiveness, never human forgiveness.
• The Greek 'aphiemi' literally means 'to send away,' like releasing a prisoner or canceling a financial debt.
• In the Lord's Prayer, 'debts' is used metaphorically for sins, linking forgiveness to the cancellation of what is owed.
• Jesus' command to forgive 'seventy times seven' times implies a limitless, ongoing attitude of mercy.

ART: A pair of weathered hands gently releasing a glowing, white dove into a dark, stormy sky; the light from the bird illuminates the hands, breaking shadowy chains around the wrists.
