• In the Old Testament, inanimate objects like altars, vessels, and clothing could be sanctified.
• The process often involved ritual washing, anointing with oil, or the sprinkling of blood.
• In the New Testament, sanctification is described as the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life.

ART: A golden censer swinging in a dark void, releasing billowing clouds of white incense smoke that catch a shaft of intense, vertical divine light; the light illuminates a single pristine ceramic vessel while leaving the surrounding area in shadow.
