# Card_Stats: LORE 5 | CONTEXT 3 | COMPLEXITY 4
# Card_Art_Prompt: A golden censer swinging in a dark void, releasing billowing clouds of white incense smoke that catch a shaft of intense, vertical divine light; the light illuminates a single pristine ceramic vessel while leaving the surrounding area in shadow.
# Card_OT_Verse: Leviticus 20:7 — Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your God.
