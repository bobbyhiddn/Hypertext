# CURRENT CARD (edit values below to request changes)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Card_Word: BLESS
# Card_Gloss: To confer prosperity, happiness, or well-being; to consecrate; to praise.
# Card_Type: VERB
# Card_Rarity: GLORIOUS
# Card_Ability: Draw 2 cards, then return a card from Sheol to your hand.
# Card_Stats: LORE 5 | CONTEXT 5 | COMPLEXITY 2
# Card_Art_Prompt: A weathered stone cup overflowing with golden liquid that spills onto dry, cracked earth, causing small green shoots to sprout instantly where it touches. Warm, radiant lighting. No text.
# Card_OT_Verse: Numbers 6:24 — The LORD bless you and keep you...
# Card_NT_Verse: Matthew 5:9 — Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
# Card_Hebrew: בָּרַךְ (barak)
# Card_Greek: εὐλογέω (eulogeō)
# Card_Trivia_1: The Hebrew 'barak' literally means 'to kneel,' implying a gift given or received on bended knee.
# Card_Trivia_2: The Greek 'eulogeo' means 'to speak well of,' which gives us the English word 'eulogy.'
# Card_Trivia_3: The Priestly Blessing (Num 6:24) was found on silver scrolls dating to 600 BC, the oldest biblical text ever discovered.
# Card_Trivia_4: In Scripture, a blessing is an irrevocable endowment of vitality and power, not merely a wish for good luck.
