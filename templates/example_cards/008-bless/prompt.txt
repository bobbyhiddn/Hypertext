LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: בָּרַךְ (barak) - Gen 1:22 • Gen 12:2 • Num 6:24 • Ps 67:1
Greek: εὐλογέω (eulogeō) - Matt 5:3 • Luke 6:28 • Rom 12:14 • James 3:9

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew 'barak' literally means 'to kneel,' implying a gift given or received on bended knee.
• The Greek 'eulogeo' means 'to speak well of,' which gives us the English word 'eulogy.'
• The Priestly Blessing (Num 6:24) was found on silver scrolls dating to 600 BC, the oldest biblical text ever discovered.
• In Scripture, a blessing is an irrevocable endowment of vitality and power, not merely a wish for good luck.

ART: A weathered stone cup overflowing with golden liquid that spills onto dry, cracked earth, causing small green shoots to sprout instantly where it touches. Warm, radiant lighting. No text.
