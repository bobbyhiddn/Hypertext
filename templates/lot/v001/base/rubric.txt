Based on the provided reference image (`template_1024x1536.png`), here is the **EXACT** visual style guide for a "Lot" type Hypertext card.

**1. FRAME/BORDER**
*   **Outer Edge:** A thin, double-line border in black/dark navy surrounding the entire card content.
*   **Main Background:** A textured, beige/tan parchment paper effect.
*   **Corner Style:** The main outer frame has chamfered (cut/angled) corners, not rounded or perfectly square.

*   **Top Right:** A rectangular navy blue box with a gold border.
    *   **Label:** "CARD COUNT" in small, white, uppercase serif text at the top.
    *   **Value:** "X-CARDS" in larger, white, uppercase serif text below the label.

**3. TITLE SECTION**
*   **Main Title:** Centered at the top. Font is large, bold, black, uppercase serif (e.g., "NAME").
*   **Subtitle:** Centered immediately below the main title. Font is smaller, black, italicized serif (e.g., "Example subtitle").

**4. REWARD BANNER**

    *   Top line: "REWARD: X Points / X Letters" in white, serif font.
    *   Bottom line: "Wreath Bonus: +2 Points (First to record)" in white, italicized serif font.

**5. VERSE LINE**
*   **Style:** A single line of text located between the Reward Banner and the Composition Section.
*   **Formatting:** Centered, black, italicized serif font.

**6. COMPOSITION SECTION**

*   **Content:** A horizontal row of icons representing card types (Book for NOUN, Pencil for VERB, Pen with sparkles for ADJECTIVE, Quill for NAME, Framed Picture for TITLE).
*   **Styling:**
    *   Icons are black silhouettes.
    *   Below each icon is a label in brackets (e.g., `[NOUN]`, `[VERB]`, `[ADJECTIVE]`, `[NAME]`, `[TITLE]`) in a serif font.
    *   Mathematical "plus" signs (`+`) separate the icon groups.

**7. CONTEXT SECTION**
*   **Container:** A large box at the bottom of the card labeled "CONTEXT".
*   **Header:** A navy blue bar with gold trim and ornate corner scrolls. Text is "CONTEXT" in white, bold, uppercase serif.
