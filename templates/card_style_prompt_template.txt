Generate a trading card following the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry of the reference style [1].

REPLACE the content with the following text. Do NOT use brackets or placeholders.

Card Number: {NUMBER}
Word: {WORD}
Gloss: {GLOSS}
Type: {CARD_TYPE}
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): {RARITY_TEXT}
Stats: Lore {STAT_LORE}, Context {STAT_CONTEXT}, Complexity {STAT_COMPLEXITY}

Art Description: {ART_PROMPT}. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: {ABILITY_TEXT}

OT Verse: {OT_VERSE_REF} — "{OT_VERSE_SNIPPET}"
NT Verse: {NT_VERSE_REF} — "{NT_VERSE_SNIPPET}"

Greek: {GREEK}
Greek Transliteration: {GREEK_TRANSLIT}
NT Refs: {NT_REFS}

Hebrew: {HEBREW}
Hebrew Transliteration: {HEBREW_TRANSLIT}
OT Refs: {OT_REFS}

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right)

Trivia:
{TRIVIA_BULLETS_FORMATTED}

Series Footer: SERIES: {SERIES}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
