Generate a trading card following the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry of the reference style [1].

REPLACE the content with the following text. Do NOT use brackets or placeholders.

Card Number: #{NUMBER}
Word: {WORD}
Gloss: {GLOSS}
Type: {CARD_TYPE}
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): {RARITY_TEXT}
Stats: Lore {STAT_LORE}, Context {STAT_CONTEXT}, Complexity {STAT_COMPLEXITY}

Art Description: {ART_PROMPT}. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: {ABILITY_TEXT}

OT Verse: {OT_VERSE_REF} — "{OT_VERSE_SNIPPET}"
NT Verse: {NT_VERSE_REF} — "{NT_VERSE_SNIPPET}"

Greek: {GREEK}
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: {GREEK_TRANSLIT}
NT Refs: {NT_REFS}

Hebrew: {HEBREW}
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: {HEBREW_TRANSLIT}
OT Refs: {OT_REFS}

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
{TRIVIA_BULLETS_FORMATTED}

Series Footer: SERIES: {SERIES}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
  WRONG: [#003] or [NOUN] or [RARE]
  CORRECT: #003 or NOUN or RARE
- Card number format: Use hash followed by 3 digits. WRONG: [#003] or 003. CORRECT: #003
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL for filled pips.
  WRONG: Gold-filled circles, yellow circles, diamond shapes, star shapes, square shapes
  CORRECT: Navy-blue filled circles (dark blue, like the card border color)
  Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining.
  Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty with just outline)
  The filled pips must be NAVY (dark blue) not gold/yellow.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
