Reproduce and refine the provided card template reference image.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the reference template [1] as your primary source. Generate a refined version that:
- Preserves the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry
- Maintains the navy/gold color scheme
- Keeps all panel positions and text zones in place
- Ensures clean, crisp rendering of all elements

TARGET TEMPLATE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Orientation: Vertical (2:3 aspect ratio, 1024x1536 pixels)
- Style: Premium trading card layout with antique parchment background
- Frame: Navy and gold collector frame with rounded corners

LAYOUT TO PRESERVE:
- Header: Collector ID (left), Rarity label (right), Title/Subtitle (center)
- Art Panel: ~44% height with gold inner frame
- Stats Row: LORE, CONTEXT, COMPLEXITY with navy circle pips
- Text Panels: Ability, OT Verse, NT Verse, Greek/Hebrew strip, Trivia
- Footer: Navy strip with "Series: 20XX QX - Set" format (e.g., "Series: 2026 Q1 - Babel")

REFINEMENT GOALS:
- Sharper text rendering
- Cleaner frame edges
- Consistent typography throughout
- Proper stat pip rendering (empty navy circles)
- Clear panel separation

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card
- Rarity badge: Display only the word "Rarity" (no diamond icon, no specific rarity name like "GLORIOUS")
- Hebrew text must render right-to-left
- Output ONLY the card - no surrounding text or watermarks

IMPORTANT CHANGES FROM REFERENCE (do NOT copy these from reference image):
- Stat pips: The reference may show FILLED pips - IGNORE THIS.
  Instead, render ALL stat pips as EMPTY/HOLLOW navy-blue circle OUTLINES ONLY.
  Each stat row should show 5 unfilled circular outlines (like ○ ○ ○ ○ ○, not ● ● ● ○ ○).
  The pips should have a navy stroke/border but NO fill - the parchment background should show through.
