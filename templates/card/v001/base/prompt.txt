Reproduce and refine the provided card template reference image.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the reference template [1] as your primary source. Generate a refined version that:
- Preserves the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry
- Maintains the navy/gold color scheme
- Keeps all panel positions and text zones in place
- Ensures clean, crisp rendering of all elements

TARGET TEMPLATE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Orientation: Vertical (2:3 aspect ratio, 1024x1536 pixels)

LAYOUT TO PRESERVE:

1. HEADER AREA

   - Top-Right: RARITY AREA with two elements side by side:
     * Rarity TEXT in white serif on navy background (e.g., "Rarity")
     * Rarity DIAMOND shape next to the text - a SOLID WHITE diamond (◆) with navy outline
   - Center: Card title in large bold black serif, subtitle below in italics

2. ART PANEL
   - ~44% of card height
   - Gold inner frame border
   - Art placeholder area

3. STATS ROW
   - Three stat categories: LORE, CONTEXT, COMPLEXITY
   - Each shows 5 circular pips
   - ALL pips should be EMPTY/HOLLOW navy circle outlines (not filled)

REFINEMENT GOALS:
- Sharper text rendering
- Cleaner frame edges
- Consistent typography throughout
- Proper stat pip rendering (empty navy circles)
- Clear panel separation

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card
- TYPE AREA (top-left):
  * Type pill: Navy rounded rectangle with WHITE text showing "TYPE" placeholder
  * Type circle: Navy circle with gold border, empty (no icon) for base template

  * Rarity text: WHITE text on navy background showing "Rarity" placeholder
  * Rarity diamond: SOLID WHITE diamond (◆) next to the text - white fill with navy outline
- Stat pips: ALL pips MUST be EMPTY/HOLLOW navy-blue circle OUTLINES ONLY
  Each stat row should show 5 unfilled circular outlines (like ○ ○ ○ ○ ○, not ● ● ● ○ ○)
  The pips should have a navy stroke/border but NO fill - the parchment background should show through
