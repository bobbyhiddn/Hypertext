Based on the provided template image, here is the exact visual style definition for a correctly rendered Hypertext card:

**1. FRAME/BORDER**
*   **Outer Edge:** The card is framed by a thick, solid **dark navy blue** border.
*   **Inner Stroke:** Immediately inside the navy border is a thin **gold/tan** stroke.
*   **Main Background:** The card background features a textured **parchment/paper** effect (beige/tan variations).
*   **Content Frame:** The internal content area is surrounded by a thin, double-line border (dark outer line, lighter gold inner line) with **chamfered (cut) corners** at the top left and right.

**2. HEADER AREA**
*   **Card Number:** Located in the top-left corner. Formatted as `#XXX` in a black, serif typeface.
*   **Part of Speech Label:** Located immediately to the right of the card number. It is a **dark navy blue lozenge (pill shape)** containing white, all-caps, serif text (e.g., "NOUN").

**3. TITLE SECTION**
*   **Main Title:** Centered horizontally at the top. Text is **large, all-caps, bold, black serif font**.
*   **Definition:** Located directly below the title. Text is **smaller, italicized, black serif font**.

**4. RARITY DISPLAY**
*   **Label:** Located in the top-right corner. It is a **dark navy blue tab** with a chamfered bottom-left corner. It contains the text "Rarity" in white serif font.
*   **Icon Placeholder:** There is a large **dark navy blue circle** with a gold rim located in the top-left area, below the card number/part of speech tag.

**5. ART PANEL**
*   **Style:** A large, empty rectangular space intended for artwork.
*   **Frame:** It is enclosed by a distinct **gold/tan frame** that features **incurved (indented) corners** at all four points.
*   **Background:** The interior of the placeholder shows the standard parchment texture.

**6. STAT PIPS**
*   **Shape:** The pips are **perfect circles (rings)**.
*   **Arrangement:** Three categories (LORE, CONTEXT, COMPLEXITY) are arranged horizontally below the art panel.
*   **Formatting:** Each category has a bold, all-caps serif header followed by a row of **5 circular pips**. In the template, these are outlined in dark grey/black and unfilled.

**7. VERSE SECTIONS**
*   **Structure:** Three stacked panels: "ABILITY", "OT VERSE", and "NT VERSE".
*   **Panel Style:** Each panel has a **gold/tan gradient background** and a border with **chamfered (cut) corners**.
*   **Typography:** Headers are centered, bold, all-caps serif. Body text is centered serif font.

**8. TRIVIA SECTION**
*   **Location:** At the bottom of the main content area.
*   **Header:** The word "TRIVIA" is centered, bold, and all-caps serif.
*   **Formatting:** Bullet points are **solid black circles**. Text is left-aligned (indented) serif font. The background is the standard parchment texture, not the gold gradient used for verses.

**9. GREEK/HEBREW STRIP**
*   **Position:** Located between the "NT VERSE" panel and the "TRIVIA" section.
*   **Style:** Two side-by-side panels sharing the **gold/tan gradient background** and chamfered borders.
*   **Left Panel:** Labeled "HEBREW/ARAMAIC".
*   **Right Panel:** Labeled "GREEK".
*   **Content:** Contains placeholders for the word, transliteration, and citations in centered serif text.

**10. FOOTER**
*   **Style:** A solid **dark navy blue strip** running the full width of the bottom of the card.
*   **Text:** White/light grey serif text, left-aligned, reading "SERIES: 20XX QX - Set".

**11. COLOR SCHEME**
*   **Primary Background:** Textured Beige/Parchment.
*   **Primary Accents:** Dark Navy Blue (Borders, Footer, Header Tags).
*   **Secondary Accents:** Gold/Tan (Panel backgrounds, inner borders).
*   **Text Color:** Primarily Black (White text only on Navy backgrounds).

**12. TYPE ICONS (inside Type Circle)**
The Type Circle is the navy circle with gold rim inside the type pill. It must contain a WHITE icon specific to the card type:

*   **NOUN:** Closed book - rectangular shape with visible spine on left, slightly curved corner
*   **VERB:** Slanted pencil - long cylinder tapering to point, rounded eraser at top
*   **ADJECTIVE:** Sparkle pencil - pencil with two small four-pointed stars emanating from middle
*   **NAME:** Feather quill - single feather/quill pen shape
*   **TITLE:** Ornate frame - decorative empty picture frame

**CRITICAL:** The type icon must match the card's type exactly. Wrong icons are a major error.

**13. RARITY DIAMONDS**
The Rarity Diamond appears next to the rarity text in the top-right area:

*   **COMMON:** Solid WHITE diamond with navy outline
*   **UNCOMMON:** Solid GREEN diamond (#2E8B57) with navy outline
*   **RARE:** Solid GOLD diamond (#C9A44C) with navy outline, plus a small "+" and card icon below
*   **GLORIOUS:** Solid ORANGE diamond (#F28C28) with navy outline, plus a small "+" and two card icons below

**CRITICAL:** The diamond color must match the rarity exactly. Wrong colors are a major error.
