Based on the provided template and reference cards, here is the exact visual style guide for a Hypertext trading card:

**1. FRAME/BORDER**
*   **Style:** The card features a double-line border. The outer edge is a thin dark navy line. Inside that is a thicker parchment margin, followed by an inner border consisting of a thin dark line and a decorative gold/bronze inner stroke.
*   **Corners:** The main card frame has standard 90-degree corners, but the internal content boxes (Art, Ability, Verses, Languages, Trivia) all feature **chamfered (notched/cut)** corners, giving them an octagonal appearance rather than a perfect rectangle.

**2. HEADER AREA**
*   **Left Side:** Contains the Card Number (format `#XXX`) followed by the Part of Speech (e.g., VERB, NOUN, ADJECTIVE). The Part of Speech is enclosed in a **dark navy pill-shaped (rounded lozenge)** container with white text.
*   **Right Side:** Contains the Rarity Label (e.g., COMMON) and a Rarity Icon. These are enclosed in a **dark navy pill-shaped** container with white text.

CRITICAL STYLE CHECKS (any mismatch = AUTOMATIC FAIL):

1. **BORDER STYLE**: Must be SIMPLE with chamfered internal boxes - NOT ornate/decorative/scrollwork
2. **VERSE HEADERS**: "OT VERSE" and "NT VERSE" must be CENTERED ABOVE the verse text - NOT in side boxes
3. **STAT PIPS**: Must be CIRCLES filled with NAVY color (dark blue #0B1F3B) - NOT black, NOT other shapes
4. **COLOR SCHEME**: Navy/gold/parchment - NOT other color schemes
5. **RARITY BADGE**: Must match the recipe rarity exactly (COMMON/UNCOMMON/RARE/GLORIOUS). COMMON = white diamond, UNCOMMON = green, RARE = gold, GLORIOUS = orange
6. **TYPE ICON**: Must show correct icon for card type in top-left circle: NOUN = closed book, VERB = running figure, ADJECTIVE = scroll, NAME = crown, TITLE = star
