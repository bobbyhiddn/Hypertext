• Pistis appears 243 times in the New Testament, appearing most frequently in Romans.

• In the Old Testament, the concept often emphasizes faithfulness, steadfastness, and reliability rather than abstract belief.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
