CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
  WRONG: [#003] or [NOUN] or [RARE]
  CORRECT: #003 or NOUN or RARE
- Card number format: Use hash followed by 3 digits. WRONG: [#003] or 003. CORRECT: #003
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL for filled pips.
  WRONG: Gold-filled circles, yellow circles, diamond shapes, star shapes, square shapes
  CORRECT: Navy-blue filled circles (dark blue, like the card border color)
  Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining.
  Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty with just outline)
  The filled pips must be NAVY (dark blue) not gold/yellow.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
