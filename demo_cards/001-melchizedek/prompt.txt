CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
