(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right)

Trivia:
• The Hebrew verb 'palal' implies intervention, judgment, or arbitration.
• The Greek 'proseuchomai' combines 'pros' (towards) and 'euchomai' (to wish or vow).
• Incense is frequently used in Scripture as a metaphor for the prayers of the saints.
• Depending on the translation, forms of this word appear over 600 times in the Bible.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
