Generate a trading card following the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry of the reference style [1].

REPLACE the content with the following text. Do NOT use brackets or placeholders.

Gloss: To address God with adoration, confession, supplication, or thanksgiving.
Type: VERB
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): COMMON (White Circle icon)
Stats: Lore 5, Context 5, Complexity 2

Art Description: A pair of weathered hands clasped together in a beam of light, ancient parchment texture, warm golden hues, dramatic lighting, no text.. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

OT Verse: 2 Chronicles 7:14 — "If my people... shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face..."

Greek: προσεύχομαι
Greek Transliteration: proseuchomai
NT Refs: Matt 6:9 • Luke 18:1 • Phil 4:6 • Jas 5:16

Hebrew: פָּלַל
Hebrew Transliteration: palal
OT Refs: Gen 20:7 • 1 Sam 1:10 • Ps 5:2 • Dan 6:10

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right)

Trivia:
• The Hebrew verb *palal* implies 'intervening' or 'judging', suggesting prayer bridges a gap.
• The Greek *proseuchomai* combines *pros* (towards) and *euchomai* (to wish or vow).
• Forms of the word 'pray' appear over 300 times in most English translations.
• The first use of *palal* is Abraham praying for Abimelech in Genesis 20:7.
• Jesus' longest recorded prayer is found in John 17.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
