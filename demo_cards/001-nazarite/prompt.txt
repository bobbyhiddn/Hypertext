OT Verse: Numbers 6:2 — "When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate himself unto the LORD..."

Greek Transliteration: Naziraios
NT Refs: Luke 1 • Acts 18 • Acts 21

Hebrew: נָזִיר
Hebrew Transliteration: Nazir

Trivia:
• The vow had three prohibitions: no fruit of the vine (wine/grapes), no razor on the head, and no contact with dead bodies.
• Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist are the only explicit lifelong Nazarites mentioned in Scripture.
• Often confused with 'Nazarene,' which refers to a resident of Nazareth (like Jesus).
• The Apostle Paul took a temporary Nazarite vow to demonstrate his Jewish faithfulness (Acts 21).

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
