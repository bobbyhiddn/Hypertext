Type: VERB
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): COMMON (White Circle icon)
Stats: Lore 5, Context 5, Complexity 2

Art Description: A single drop of water falling into a still, dark blue pool, creating bright golden concentric ripples that expand outward into the darkness.. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Trivia:
• The Hebrew 'shema' implies that if you have not obeyed, you have not truly heard.
• This word forms the title of the central Jewish prayer, recited morning and evening.
• The Greek 'akouo' is the etymological root of the English word 'acoustic'.
• Jesus frequently used the idiom, 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear.'

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
