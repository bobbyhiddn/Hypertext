- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "The divine plural in Genesis 11:7—"Come, let us go down"—foreshadows the collaborative agency of the Triune Godhead acting in judgment. This revelation contrasts the perfect, uncreated unity of the Father, Son, and Spirit with the rebellious, manufactured unity of mankind."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"
