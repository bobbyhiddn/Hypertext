- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Contrasting the linguistic chaos of Babel, the benediction is the authoritative pronouncement of God's "good word" that places His name upon His people (Numbers 6:27). This liturgical act seals the faithful in divine favor, transforming the uncertainty of dispersion into the assurance of covenant peace."
