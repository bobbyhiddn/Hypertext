- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Amidst the judgment of dispersion at Babel, God sovereignly preserves the lineage of Shem, demonstrating that human rebellion cannot thwart redemptive history (Genesis 11:10-26). This motif underscores that even in universal apostasy, a faithful seed is secured to carry the covenant forward."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
