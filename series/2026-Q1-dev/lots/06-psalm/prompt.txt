TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.

- Composition: ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE + VERB + NOUN
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Serving as the liturgical response to divine revelation, the Psalms redeem human language from the confusion of Babel by reorienting speech toward the glory of YHWH. This phase signifies the shift from the hubris of self-exaltation to the humble confidence of the "songs of Zion" (Psalm 137:3)."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template
- Navy tab badge shape for "LOT" (top-left)
- Navy rectangle with gold border for card count (top-right)
- Navy ribbon banner with gold trim for reward section
- Decorative corner flourishes on composition box
- Navy "CONTEXT" header bar above context text

STYLE MATCHING:

- Match icon style for card types (book, pen, quill, frame icons)
- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px

AVOID:
- Text rendering errors or garbled characters
