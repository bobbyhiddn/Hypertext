Generate a trading card following the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry of the reference style [1].

REPLACE the content with the following text. Do NOT use brackets or placeholders.

Card Number: #001
Word: MAGI
Gloss: Learned visitors from the East; wise men, astrologers, or priestly officials.
Type: TITLE
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): GLORIOUS with orange diamond icon
Stats: Lore 5, Context 1, Complexity 3

Art Description: A moonlit caravan of eastern scholars on camels approaching a distant city beneath a brilliant star; ancient Near Eastern desert; painterly mythic realism; NO TEXT OR WRITING IN ART.. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: On reveal, you may spend 1 card from your hand to activate that card's ability. Then this card is spent.

OT Verse: Daniel 2:2 — "summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, Chaldeans..."
NT Verse: Matthew 2:1 — "magi from the east came to Jerusalem..."

Greek: μάγος / μάγοι
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: magos / magoi
NT Refs: Matt 2:1 • Acts 13:6

Hebrew: חרטמים / חכימין
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: ḥarṭummîm / ḥăkîmîn
OT Refs: Dan 2:2 • Dan 4:7

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• Matthew never calls them kings, and never gives a number.
• The same Greek root appears in Acts 13:6 in a negative context.
• Daniel's court vocabulary overlaps with 'wise/magician' categories.
• This label's moral weight is decided by context, not the word alone.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
  WRONG: [#003] or [NOUN] or [RARE]
  CORRECT: #003 or NOUN or RARE
- Card number format: Use hash followed by 3 digits. WRONG: [#003] or 003. CORRECT: #003
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL for filled pips.
  WRONG: Gold-filled circles, yellow circles, diamond shapes, star shapes, square shapes
  CORRECT: Navy-blue filled circles (dark blue, like the card border color)
  Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining.
  Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty with just outline)
  The filled pips must be NAVY (dark blue) not gold/yellow.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
