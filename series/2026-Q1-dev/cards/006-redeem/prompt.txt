Generate a trading card following the EXACT layout, frame, and geometry of the reference style [1].

REPLACE the content with the following text. Do NOT use brackets or placeholders.

Card Number: #006
Word: REDEEM
Gloss: To buy back, recover, or liberate by payment; to clear a debt or restore rights.
Type: VERB
DRAW Rarity (Top Right): RARE with gold diamond icon
Stats: Lore 5, Context 4, Complexity 3

Art Description: A heavy, rusted iron shackle lying open on a cold stone floor, illuminated by a single intense shaft of golden light breaking through shadows. Beside it, a small pile of ancient silver coins.. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: Return 3 cards from the discard pile to your hand that have LORE 3 or higher.

OT Verse: Psalm 107:2 — "Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy."
NT Verse: Galatians 3:13 — "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us."

Greek: ἐξαγοράζω
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: exagorazō
NT Refs: Eph 1:7 • Titus 2:14 • 1 Pet 1:18 • Rev 5:9

Hebrew: גָּאַל
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: ga'al
OT Refs: Job 19:25 • Isa 43:1 • Ruth 4:14 • Ex 6:6

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• The Hebrew 'ga'al' refers to a 'kinsman-redeemer' obligated to buy back enslaved relatives or lost property.
• In the Greek marketplace, 'exagorazo' meant to buy a slave specifically to grant them freedom.
• The Book of Ruth serves as a narrative case study of the kinsman-redeemer law in action.
• Job's famous cry 'I know that my Redeemer lives' envisions a legal vindicator standing up for him.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
  WRONG: [#003] or [NOUN] or [RARE]
  CORRECT: #003 or NOUN or RARE
- Card number format: Use hash followed by 3 digits. WRONG: [#003] or 003. CORRECT: #003
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL for filled pips.
  WRONG: Gold-filled circles, yellow circles, diamond shapes, star shapes, square shapes
  CORRECT: Navy-blue filled circles (dark blue, like the card border color)
  Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining.
  Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty with just outline)
  The filled pips must be NAVY (dark blue) not gold/yellow.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
