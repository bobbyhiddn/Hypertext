## Word
**BUILD** — To construct, establish, or strengthen; to edify or raise up a structure or family.

## Old Testament

## New Testament
> Matthew 16:18 — "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."

## Trivia
- The Hebrew word 'banah' (build) shares a root with 'ben' (son), linking house-building to family-building.
- In the New Testament, the word for 'edification' literally translates to 'house-building' (oikodomeō).
- Jesus was a 'tekton', a term often translated as 'carpenter' but more accurately meaning 'builder' or 'stonemason'.
- Ancient builders used a cornerstone to align the entire structure; the Messiah is often called the 'chief cornerstone'.
