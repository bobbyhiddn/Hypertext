Greek: χάρις
Greek Transliteration: Charis
NT Refs: Rom 3:24 • Rom 5:20 • Eph 2:8 • Tit 2:11

Hebrew: חֵן
Hebrew Transliteration: Chen
OT Refs: Gen 6:8 • Ex 33:17 • Ps 84:11 • Prov 3:34

Trivia:
• The Greek word *charis* is the root of English words like 'charity' and 'charisma'.
• In the Old Testament, *chen* comes from a root meaning 'to bend or stoop' in kindness.
• Grace is often distinguished from mercy: mercy is withholding punishment, while grace is bestowing blessing.
• The Apostle Paul uses this term over 100 times to describe God's unearned favor.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
