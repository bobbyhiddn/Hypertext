The scene emphasizes the contrast between the undeserving recipient and the precious gift. Cinematic lighting, photorealistic, 8k resolution. No text..

OT Verse: Genesis 6:8 — "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD."

Greek: χάρις
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: charis
NT Refs: John 1:14 • Rom 3:24 • Eph 2:8 • Heb 4:16

Hebrew: חֵן
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: chen
OT Refs: Gen 6:8 • Ex 33:19 • Ps 84:11 • Prov 3:34

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• The Greek word 'charis' is the etymological root of the English words 'charity' and 'charisma'.
• In the Old Testament, 'chen' often implies a superior stooping down to show kindness to an inferior.
• The Apostle Paul uses the word 'grace' over 100 times across his epistles.
• Grace is often distinguished from mercy: mercy is not receiving the punishment one deserves, while grace is receiving a blessing one does not deserve.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
  WRONG: [#003] or [NOUN] or [RARE]
  CORRECT: #003 or NOUN or RARE
- Card number format: Use hash followed by 3 digits. WRONG: [#003] or 003. CORRECT: #003
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL for filled pips.
  WRONG: Gold-filled circles, yellow circles, diamond shapes, star shapes, square shapes
  CORRECT: Navy-blue filled circles (dark blue, like the card border color)
  Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining.
  Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty with just outline)
  The filled pips must be NAVY (dark blue) not gold/yellow.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
