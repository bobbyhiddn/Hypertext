TRIVIA:
• "Charis" (Greek) originally meant "beauty" or "charm" before the New Testament gave it deep theological weight.
• "Chen" (Hebrew) comes from a root meaning "to bend or stoop," depicting a superior showing kindness to an inferior.
• Grace is often defined as receiving what you do not deserve, while mercy is not receiving the punishment you do deserve.
• The Apostle Paul uses the word "grace" over 100 times in his letters, making it a central theme of his theology.
