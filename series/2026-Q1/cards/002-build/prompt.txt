RARITY: COMMON (use matching rarity badge style from references)

STATS (each has 5 pip slots total):
LORE: 2/5 filled
CONTEXT: 4/5 filled
COMPLEXITY: 2/5 filled

ABILITY:
Look at the top 2 cards of the Tower; put one into your hand and the other on the bottom.

VERSES:
OT: Psalm 127:1 — “Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.”
NT: Matthew 16:18 — “On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.”

LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: בָּנָה (banah) - Gen 11:4 • 1 Kings 6:1 • Neh 4:6 • Prov 24:3
Greek: οἰκοδομέω (oikodomeō) - Matt 7:24 • 1 Cor 3:10 • Eph 2:20 • 1 Pet 2:5

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew word for 'son' (ben) shares the same root as 'build' (banah), implying sons build the family line.
• In Genesis 2:22, God 'built' Eve from Adam's rib, using the architectural verb rather than 'formed' or 'created'.
• Jesus is often called a carpenter, but the Greek 'tekton' can more broadly mean a builder or stonemason.

ART: Rough-hewn stone blocks stacking upward into a golden light, a plumb line hanging straight down in the foreground, ancient architectural style, warm lighting, digital painting
