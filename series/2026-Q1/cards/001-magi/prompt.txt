NT Refs: Matt 2:1 • Matt 2:11 • Acts 8:9 • Acts 13:6

Hebrew: רַב־מָג

Trivia:
• Derived from the Old Persian word 'magu', referring to a priestly caste skilled in astrology.
• Scripture never states there were three men, only three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
• The title 'Rab-mag' (Chief Magus) appears in Jeremiah, a rank Daniel likely held in Babylon.
• They were not kings, but likely advisors and astronomers from the Parthian Empire.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
