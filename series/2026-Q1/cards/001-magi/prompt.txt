Greek: μάγοι

Trivia:
• The English word 'magic' is etymologically derived from this term.
• Scripture never specifies there were three men, only that there were three gifts.
• Likely Zoroastrian astronomer-priests from the Parthian Empire (modern Iran).
• The prophet Daniel was appointed chief of the wise men in Babylon, possibly establishing the legacy these men followed.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
