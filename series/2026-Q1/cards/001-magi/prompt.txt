• The term originally referred to a priestly caste in the Persian Empire, likely Zoroastrian.
• Scripture never states there were three men, only that they brought three types of gifts.
• In the book of Daniel, the prophet was made chief over the 'wise men' of Babylon.
• The Greek word 'magos' is also the root for the English word 'magic' and 'magician'.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
