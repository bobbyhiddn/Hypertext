## Word
**MAGI** — Learned visitors from the East; wise men, astrologers, or priestly officials.

## Old Testament
> Daniel 2:2 — “summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, Chaldeans...”

## New Testament
> Matthew 2:1 — “magi from the east came to Jerusalem...”

## Trivia
- Matthew never calls them kings, and never gives a number.
- The same Greek root appears in Acts 13:6 in a negative context.
- Daniel's court vocabulary overlaps with 'wise/magician' categories.
- This label's moral weight is decided by context, not the word alone.
