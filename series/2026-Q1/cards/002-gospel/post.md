## Word
**GOSPEL** — Good news; a joyful announcement of victory or salvation

## Old Testament
> Isaiah 52:7 — “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace.”

## New Testament
> Romans 1:16 — “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.”

## Trivia
- The Old English word 'godspel' literally means 'good story' or 'good tidings,' translating the Latin 'evangelium'.
- In secular Greek, the term originally referred to the reward given to a messenger for bringing good news, before coming to mean the message itself.
- The Roman Empire used this word to announce the birthday of the Emperor or a military victory, making the Christian usage a subversive political claim that Jesus was the true King.
