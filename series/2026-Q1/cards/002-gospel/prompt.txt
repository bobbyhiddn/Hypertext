Greek: εὐαγγέλιον
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: euangelion
NT Refs: Mark 1:1 • 1 Cor 15:1 • Gal 1:6 • Rev 14:6

Hebrew: בְּשׂוֹרָה
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: besorah
OT Refs: Isa 40:9 • Isa 61:1 • Nah 1:15 • Ps 96:2

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• Derived from the Old English 'godspell', literally meaning 'good story' or 'good news'.
• In secular ancient Greek, the word was used for announcements of military victory or an emperor's birth.
• Paul defines the core content of the gospel in 1 Corinthians 15 as Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.
• The Hebrew equivalent is rooted in the idea of a messenger bringing fresh tidings from the battlefront.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
