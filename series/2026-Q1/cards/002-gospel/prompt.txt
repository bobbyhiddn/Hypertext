Trivia:
• Derived from the Old English 'godspell', meaning 'good story' or 'good tidings'.
• In the Roman Empire, this term was used for imperial announcements, such as the birthday or accession of Caesar.
• The Greek word originally referred to the reward given to a messenger for bringing good news, before coming to mean the message itself.
• While there are four written Gospels, the New Testament often speaks of 'the gospel' as a singular, unified message of salvation.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
