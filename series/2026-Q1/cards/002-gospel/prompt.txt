OT Verse: Isaiah 52:7 — "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace..."
NT Verse: Romans 1:16 — "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth..."

Greek: εὐαγγέλιον
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: Euangelion
NT Refs: Mark 1:1 • Rom 1:16 • 1 Cor 15:1-4 • Gal 1:6-9

Hebrew: בְּשׂוֹרָה
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: Besorah
OT Refs: Isa 40:9 • Isa 52:7 • Isa 61:1 • Nah 1:15

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• Derived from Old English 'god-spell' (good story), a translation of the Greek 'euangelion'.
• In the Roman world, 'euangelion' was a technical term for news of military victory or an emperor's birth.
• The 'Proto-Evangelium' (First Gospel) in Genesis 3:15 promises the seed of the woman will crush the serpent.
• Paul explicitly defines the content of the gospel in 1 Corinthians 15 as Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
