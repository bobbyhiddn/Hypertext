Trivia:
• Derived from Old English 'godspell' (good story), a calque of the Greek 'euangelion'.
• In the Roman Empire, this term was used for imperial announcements, such as a military victory or the emperor's birthday.
• The 'Proto-Evangelium' (first gospel) is often identified as the promise in Genesis 3:15.
• Paul specifically defines the content of the gospel in 1 Corinthians 15 as Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
