Card Number: 002
Word: GOSPEL
Gloss: Good news; a joyful announcement of victory or salvation
Type: NOUN
Rarity: RARE (Gold Hexagon icon)
Stats: Lore 5, Context 4, Complexity 3

Art Description: A weary but triumphant messenger running across sunlit mountain peaks at dawn, holding a closed scroll case high, with golden rays of light breaking through storm clouds in the background. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: You may reveal a card from your hand. Reveal cards from the top of the shared deck equal to that card's Lore stat; keep one and discard the rest.

OT Verse: Isaiah 52:7 — "How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace..."

Trivia:
• Derived from the Old English 'godspell', meaning 'good story'.
• In Rome, used for imperial announcements like Caesar's birthday.
• Originally referred to the reward for good news, then the message itself.
• The NT speaks of 'the gospel' as a singular message of salvation.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- Do NOT print brackets [ ] or placeholders like [Ability description]. This follows for rarity as well.
- Stat pips must be filled with navy pips equal to their values under Lore, Context, and Complexity. For example, 3 lore would look like 3 filled circles and two empty ones.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
