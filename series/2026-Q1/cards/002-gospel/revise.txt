Rarity_Change_Request: <leave blank unless changing rarity>

Ability_Change_Request: Instead of shared deck, say "the deck" and we need to make the ability potentially worth it. Right now, that's a pretty tough sell to use it and gambles Gospel plus the next card if the user is wrong. Plus it's not thematic to the gospel really. How about something like, "You may reveal a card from your hand, and if its lore is higher than 4, you may draw two cards." That way we are proclaiming the good news, the lore, and being rewarded for it.
