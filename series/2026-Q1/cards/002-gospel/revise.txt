# Hypertext Card Revision Form (revise.txt)
#
# Edit this file in your PR branch, then run the "Revise Hypertext Card" workflow.
#
# This form controls the ONLY allowed gameplay-impacting changes:
# - Rarity
# - Ability
# - Stats
#
# Notes:
# - Leave a field blank to keep it unchanged.
# - The revise pipeline will reject any changes outside the fields you fill in.
# - General_Revision_Request provides extra context but does NOT grant permission to change fields.
# - Lines starting with # are ignored.

Rarity_Change_Request: <leave blank unless changing rarity>

Ability_Change_Request: Love the ability, but let's have it say "You may reveal a card from your hand" and use that 
card's lore stat instead of a context stat. Other than that, looks great. 
Stats_Change_Request: <optional; if changing, specify LORE/CONTEXT/COMPLEXITY targets>

General_Revision_Request: <optional context; e.g. tone, complexity, fun-factor; still must fill specific change fields above>
