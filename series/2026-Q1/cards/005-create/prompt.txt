VERSES:

LANGUAGES:
Hebrew: בָּרָא (bara) - Gen 1:1 • Gen 1:27 • Ps 51:10 • Isa 40:28 • Isa 45:12
Greek: κτίζω (ktizō) - Eph 2:10 • Col 1:16 • Rev 4:11 • Rom 1:25 • Eph 3:9

TRIVIA:
• The Hebrew verb 'bara' is used exclusively for God's creative acts in the Bible.
• Creation 'ex nihilo' (out of nothing) is a distinct theological concept from reshaping matter.
• This is the very first verb used in the Scriptures.

ART: A pair of glowing, translucent hands shaping a swirling galaxy of dust and stars into a perfect sphere; cosmic background, ethereal style, no text.
