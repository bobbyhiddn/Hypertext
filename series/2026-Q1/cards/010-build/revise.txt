# CURRENT CARD (edit values below to request changes)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Card_Word: BUILD
# Card_Gloss: To construct, establish, or strengthen; to edify or raise up a structure or family.
# Card_Type: VERB
# Card_Rarity: COMMON
# Card_Ability: Look at the top 3 cards of the Tower, then put them back in any order.
# Card_Stats: LORE 3 | CONTEXT 4 | COMPLEXITY 2
# Card_Art_Prompt: Ancient stone foundation blocks being set in place with a plumb line and trowel under a bright sky; no text.
# Card_OT_Verse: Psalm 127:1 — Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain.
# Card_NT_Verse: Matthew 16:18 — On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
# Card_Hebrew: בָּנָה (banah)
# Card_Greek: οἰκοδομέω (oikodomeō)
# Card_Trivia_1: The Hebrew word 'banah' (build) shares a root with 'ben' (son), linking house-building to family-building.
# Card_Trivia_2: In the New Testament, the word for 'edification' literally translates to 'house-building' (oikodomeō).
# Card_Trivia_3: Jesus was a 'tekton', a term often translated as 'carpenter' but more accurately meaning 'builder' or 'stonemason'.
# Card_Trivia_4: Ancient builders used a cornerstone to align the entire structure; the Messiah is often called the 'chief cornerstone'.
