# Hypertext Card Revision Form (revise.txt)

# Edit this file in your PR branch, then run the "Revise Hypertext Card" workflow.
#
# This form controls the ONLY allowed gameplay-impacting changes:
# - Rarity
# - Ability
# - Stats
#
# Notes:
# - Leave a field blank to keep it unchanged.
# - The revise pipeline will reject any changes outside the fields you fill in.
# - General_Revision_Request provides extra context but does NOT grant permission to change fields.
# - Lines starting with # are ignored.
