OT Verse: Jeremiah 31:31 — "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."

Greek: διαθήκη
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: diathēkē
NT Refs: Matt 26:28 • Gal 3:17 • Heb 8:6 • Heb 12:24

Hebrew: בְּרִית
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: berith
OT Refs: Gen 9:9 • Gen 15:18 • Ex 24:8 • Ps 89:3

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• The Hebrew idiom 'karat berith' literally means 'to cut a covenant', referring to the practice of cutting sacrificial animals.
• The Greek term 'diatheke' was chosen over 'syntheke' to emphasize God's sovereign initiative rather than a mutual contract.
• Major biblical covenants include the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and the New Covenant.
• In the ancient Near East, parties would walk between cut animal pieces to invoke a curse upon themselves if they broke the vow.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
