OT Verse: Jeremiah 31:31 — "Behold, the days are coming... when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel."

Greek: διαθήκη
(Below Greek, smaller text) Transliteration: diathēkē
NT Refs: Matt 26:28 • Rom 11:27 • 2 Cor 3:6 • Gal 4:24 • Heb 9:15

Hebrew: בְּרִית
(Below Hebrew, smaller text) Transliteration: berit

(Format the Greek/Hebrew strip exactly as the reference style: Greek on left, Hebrew on right. Place transliterations BELOW their respective scripts in smaller text, not next to them.)

Trivia:
• The Hebrew phrase 'karat berit' literally means 'to cut a covenant,' referring to the ritual of cutting animals in two.
• There are five major covenants in the Old Testament: Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and the New Covenant prophesied by Jeremiah.
• The Greek word 'diatheke' was chosen by Septuagint translators over 'syntheke' to emphasize God's initiative rather than a mutual contract.
• Covenants are typically accompanied by a sign, such as the rainbow, circumcision, or the Sabbath.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small circles with SOLID NAVY FILL (not gold). Filled navy circles = stat value, empty/outlined circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 navy-filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use gold fill for stat pips. Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
