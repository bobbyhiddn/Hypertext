Art Description: Two ancient stone tablets glowing with golden light, resting on a rough-hewn altar beneath a starry sky, with a faint ethereal cord binding them together.. Art style must match the premium antique parchment aesthetic of the reference.

Ability Text: Declare a suit. All other players give you a card of that suit. If they cannot, they reveal their hand.

OT Verse: Jeremiah 31:33 — "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
NT Verse: Luke 22:20 — "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."

Greek: διαθήκη
Greek Transliteration: Diatheke
NT Refs: Matt 26:28 • Heb 8:6 • Heb 9:15 • Gal 3:17

Hebrew: בְּרִית
Hebrew Transliteration: Berit

Trivia:
• The Hebrew word 'berit' comes from a root meaning 'to cut,' referring to the ancient custom of walking between cut animal pieces to seal a pact.
• In Greek, 'diatheke' can also translate to 'last will and testament,' implying an inheritance.
• Jeremiah 31 is the only place in the Old Testament where the phrase 'New Covenant' is explicitly used.
• Major biblical covenants include those with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maintain the reference card's navy/gold frame EXACTLY.
- Keep the exact same text box positions and styles.
- NEVER print brackets [ ] anywhere on the card. Write text directly without brackets.
- Rarity display (top right): Print the rarity word followed by a small diamond icon. The diamond color matches rarity: white=COMMON, green=UNCOMMON, gold=RARE, orange=GLORIOUS. Format: "RARE ◆" not "◆ RARE".
- Stat pips: Use small NAVY circles only. Filled circles = stat value, empty circles = remaining. Example: Lore 3 = ●●●○○ (3 filled, 2 empty). Do NOT use diamond shapes for stat pips.
- Do not add extra text or modify the layout.
