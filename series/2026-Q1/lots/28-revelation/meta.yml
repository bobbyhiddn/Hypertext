flavor: Every tongue is silenced when the heavens finally speak.
context: In the narrative of Babel, revelation manifests as a judicial descent (Genesis
  11:5), where Yahweh intervenes to dismantle human hubris and reassert His sovereign
  governance over the nations. This phase emphasizes the theological reality that
  true knowledge of the divine is not achieved through human ascent, but is granted
  solely through God's gracious self-disclosure.
