- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Comprising the first five books of the Hebrew canon, the Pentateuch establishes the covenantal framework and primeval history, including the judgment of nations at Babel (Genesis 11). This foundational era defines the tension between human hubris and divine Law, setting the stage for the redemptive election of Abraham."
