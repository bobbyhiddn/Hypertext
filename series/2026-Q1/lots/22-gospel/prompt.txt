TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.

CARD CONTENT:
- Title: "GOSPEL"

- Wreath bonus: "Wreath Bonus: +2 Points (First to record)"
- Composition: NAME + VERB + NOUN + ADJECTIVE + TITLE + VERB
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Contrasting Babel’s futile attempt at human ascension, the Gospel proclaims God’s gracious descent to redeem a scattered people. This good news reverses the confusion of languages by uniting every tribe and tongue under the Lordship of Jesus Christ."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template

- Decorative corner flourishes on composition box
- Navy "CONTEXT" header bar above context text

STYLE MATCHING:
- Match color palette: Navy (#102030), Gold (#C0A060), Parchment background
- Apply same artistic finish and texture as examples
- Use consistent serif typography
- Match icon style for card types (book, pen, quill, frame icons)
- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px

AVOID:
- Text rendering errors or garbled characters

- Missing sections or labels
- Wrong card count or points values
