TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.

- Composition: NAME + VERB + VERB + NOUN + NOUN
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Functioning as the Spirit-inspired connective tissue of the early Church, the Epistle counters the fragmentation of Babel by uniting scattered believers under apostolic authority. These letters transcend geographic and cultural barriers to cultivate a singular mind and doctrine among the body of Christ (1 Cor. 1:10)."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template

STYLE MATCHING:

- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px
