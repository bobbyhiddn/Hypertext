- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Defying the Noahic mandate to disperse and fill the earth, humanity congregated at Shinar to consolidate power and manufacture a name for themselves (Genesis 11:4). This gathering illustrates the theological peril of unity founded upon anthropocentric pride rather than submission to God's sovereign rule."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"
