IMAGE ROLES:
[1] Lot_Template: Card template showing structure, borders, and text zones
[2] Creation: Completed example card showing target style and finish
[3] Epistle: Completed example card showing target style and finish
[4] lot_1024x1536: Completed example card showing target style and finish

TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.
Apply the visual style, coloring, shading, and artistic finish from the example cards.

CARD CONTENT:
- Title: "PROVERB"
- Subtitle (italic): "Better a silent heart than a tower of babbling tongues."
- Top left badge: "LOT"
- Top right: "CARD COUNT" label (small) above "5-CARD" value (larger)
- Reward banner: "REWARD: 8 Points"
- Wreath bonus: "Wreath Bonus: +2 Points (First to record)"
- Composition: ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE + VERB + NOUN + TITLE
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Representing the antithesis of Babel’s confusion, the biblical proverb (*mashal*) grounds the believer in the fear of the Lord rather than the hubris of human autonomy (Proverbs 1:7). This phase emphasizes the didactic application of divine wisdom to dismantle the folly of self-exaltation."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template
- Navy tab badge shape for "LOT" (top-left)
- Navy rectangle with gold border for card count (top-right)
- Navy ribbon banner with gold trim for reward section
- Decorative corner flourishes on composition box
- Navy "CONTEXT" header bar above context text

STYLE MATCHING:
- Match color palette: Navy (#102030), Gold (#C0A060), Parchment background
- Apply same artistic finish and texture as examples
- Use consistent serif typography
- Match icon style for card types (book, pen, quill, frame icons)
- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px

AVOID:
- Text rendering errors or garbled characters
- Border distortion or misalignment
- Missing sections or labels
- Wrong card count or points values
