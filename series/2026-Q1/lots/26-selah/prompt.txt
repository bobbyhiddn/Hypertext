- Composition: NOUN + NOUN + NOUN + NOUN + NOUN + NOUN
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Functioning as a liturgical rubric within the Psalms, *Selah* likely denotes a musical interlude or suspension of the voice to facilitate solemn meditation. This pause invites the believer to weigh the gravity of divine revelation, contrasting the noise of human confusion with the silence of holy reflection."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px
