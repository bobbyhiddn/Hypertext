TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.
Apply the visual style, coloring, shading, and artistic finish from the example cards.

CARD CONTENT:
- Title: "PROPHECY"
- Subtitle (italic): "What is built in pride shall be scattered in confusion."
- Top left badge: "LOT"
- Top right: "CARD COUNT" label (small) above "6-CARD" value (larger)
- Reward banner: "REWARD: 10 Points"
- Wreath bonus: "Wreath Bonus: +2 Points (First to record)"
- Composition: ADJECTIVE + ADJECTIVE + NAME + NAME + NOUN + VERB
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Prophecy serves as the divine utterance that pierces human confusion, asserting God's sovereign will over the hubris of nations attempting to build apart from Him. By dismantling the autonomy of the builders at Shinar, the prophetic word establishes the necessity of reliance on God's revelation rather than human innovation (Genesis 11:7-9)."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template
- Navy tab badge shape for "LOT" (top-left)
- Navy rectangle with gold border for card count (top-right)
- Navy ribbon banner with gold trim for reward section
- Decorative corner flourishes on composition box
- Navy "CONTEXT" header bar above context text

STYLE MATCHING:
- Match color palette: Navy (#102030), Gold (#C0A060), Parchment background
- Apply same artistic finish and texture as examples
- Use consistent serif typography
- Match icon style for card types (book, pen, quill, frame icons)
- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px

AVOID:
- Text rendering errors or garbled characters
- Border distortion or misalignment
- Missing sections or labels
- Wrong card count or points values
