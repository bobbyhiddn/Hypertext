TASK:
Generate a new LOT card using the structural layout from the template image.
Apply the visual style, coloring, shading, and artistic finish from the example cards.

CARD CONTENT:
- Title: "COVENANT"
- Subtitle (italic): "A covenant of burnt brick, defying the silent stars."
- Top left badge: "LOT"
- Top right: "CARD COUNT" label (small) above "5-CARD" value (larger)
- Reward banner: "REWARD: 8 Points"
- Wreath bonus: "Wreath Bonus: +2 Points (First to record)"
- Composition: NAME + VERB + NOUN + NOUN + ADJECTIVE
- Context header: "CONTEXT"
- Context body: "Standing in stark contrast to the human autonomy of Babel, the covenant represents a sovereign administration of grace wherein God unilaterally binds Himself to a people for their redemption. This phase marks the theological pivot from the judgment of dispersion to the particular election of a lineage through whom all families of the earth will be blessed."
- Footer left: "SERIES: 2026-Q1 Lots"

PRESERVATION:
- Exact border structure and double-frame from template
- Navy tab badge shape for "LOT" (top-left)
- Navy rectangle with gold border for card count (top-right)
- Navy ribbon banner with gold trim for reward section
- Decorative corner flourishes on composition box
- Navy "CONTEXT" header bar above context text

STYLE MATCHING:
- Match color palette: Navy (#102030), Gold (#C0A060), Parchment background
- Apply same artistic finish and texture as examples
- Use consistent serif typography
- Match icon style for card types (book, pen, quill, frame icons)
- Composition type labels WITHOUT square brackets (e.g., "NOUN + VERB", NOT "[NOUN] + [VERB]")

OUTPUT: 2:3 portrait, 1024x1536px

AVOID:
- Text rendering errors or garbled characters
- Border distortion or misalignment
- Missing sections or labels
- Wrong card count or points values
